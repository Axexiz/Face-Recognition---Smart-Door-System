# Face-Recognition---Smart-Door-System
I implemented an AI face recognition system that helps to detect authorized users which then sends serial inputs from the computer to the arduino board. Afterwards the arduino will detect the cooresponding inputs and act based on it. If it recieves an input of 1, it will set the method to true and will cause the door to open.Else,will remain closed
